            <h1>Beginners Basics</h1>
            <p>
                This guide will focus on the latest version of Minecraft Java Edition, 1.21.5, it will teach you the basics of the game.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Creating Your World</h2>
            <div class="imager-textl">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>
                        The first thing you'll see when you open Minecraft is the title screen, with five main buttons, "Singleplayer", "Multiplayer", "Minecraft Realms",
                        "Options", and "Quit Game". This guide will be focusing on singleplayer survival Minecraft, so click "Singleplayer". 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You'll be taken to a screen that is the list of all of your worlds, if this is your first time playing you'll instead be directly taken 
                        to the create a world screen. If you have already have a world and want to create a new one, click the "Create New World" button near the bottom of the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now you are at the screen where you'll name your new world by typing in the box that's titled "World Name,
                        choose your gamemode.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <img src="./Images/Basics/TitleScreen.png" alt="Title Screen">
            </div>
            <!-- Game-->
            <div class="imager-textl">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <h3>Gamemode</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gamemode fundementally changes how you play the game, it determines how you interact with the world of Minecraft.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Survival</h4>
                    <p>
                        In survival mode, as the name implies, your goal is to survive in the world of Minecraft. You gather resources, manage hunger, 
                        and try to avoid dying. This guide will focus on survival.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Creative</h4>
                    <p>
                        Creative mode is primarily used for building, you have unlimited resources and you can fly, nothing can kill you and you have no hunger or health.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Hardcore</h4>
                    <p>
                        Hardcore mode is almost exactly like survival, the only difference is that the difficulty is permanently set to hard
                        and if you die you cannot play your world anymore, you can only spectate it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Difficulty</h3>
                    <h4>Easy</h4>
                    <p>
                        In easy difficulty hostile mobs spawn but they do less damage. 
                        You lose hunger slower and when you run out of hunger you're health is slowly depleteed to 5 hearts. 
                        This difficulty is recommended for beginners.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Normal</h4>
                    <p>
                        In normal difficulty hostile mobs spawn and do a standard amount of damage. 
                        You lose hunger at a standard rate and when you run out of hunger you're health is slowly depleted to half a heart.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Hard</h4>
                    <p>
                        In hard difficulty hostile mobs spawn and do more damage.
                        You lose hunger faster and when you run out of hunger your health is slowly depleted until you reach zero hearts and die.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Peaceful</h4>
                    <p>
                        In peaceful difficulty hostile mobs do not spawn and certain neutral mobs do not spawn either. You do not lose hunger and therefore can't starve.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <img src="./Images/Basics/GameTab.png" alt="Title Screen">

                <div class="text-content">
                <h3>Seeds & World Type</h3>
                <p>Once you've chosen a name, gamemode, and difficulty for your world it's time to choose your world's Seed and World Type, to get to these options
                    click the world tab located at the top of the screen in the center.
                </p>
                <h4>Seed</h4>
                <p>
                    A seed in Minecraft is a string of characters and numbers that determines how your world generates, 
                    think of it as a recipe, every seed is it's own recipe and the game uses it to generate the world,
                    if two worlds have the same seed, then they have the same world generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you don't know what seed to pick, you can leave the box empty and it will choose one randomly for you.
                    If your a beginner and in Minecraft version 1.21.5, I'd recommend using the seed "1" since it spawns you near useful resources.
                </p>
                <h4>World Type</h4>
                <p>
                    World type is another determiner in how your world generates, you can have normal world generation, make your entire world one biome, 
                    make it completely flat, have super tall world generation, or have larger biomes. Though this guide will stick to "default" world generation.
                    [Note: If you picked a world type other than default and chose the recommended seed, it will not be the same as a default world with a seed of 1].
                </p>
                <h4>Bonus Chest</h4>
                <p>
                    The bonus chest is a chest that spawns near you when you first load into your world, it has useful early game items 
                    and is recommended for beginners to turn this option on.
                </p>
                <!-- more -->
                <h3>Game Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    After you've decided on your seed and world type, go to the more tab, which is to the right of the world tab. The only thing that you need
                    to worry about here is the "Game Rules" button, click it. There are two rules of interest here, the first one is labeled "Keep inventory
                    after death", turning this on causes you not to drop all of your items when you die, this is recommended for beginners. The second rule of 
                    interest is labeled "Update fire", turning this off causes fire not to spread, this is useful since lightning can strike a wooden structure 
                    that you've built and set it on fire during thunderstorms, if you turn this rule off, the fire won't spread and burn down your entire build. 
                </p>
                <p>Once you've decided on these two rules, you're good to create your world, click the "Create New World" button on the bottom of the screen.</p>

                    <h3>Gathering Wood</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first thing you should do after spawning into your world is to look at your surroundings,
                        if there's trees go punch one by holding left click to collect some wood so you can craft a crafting table and make some tools. 
                        Find the crafting recipes for the crafting table and tools <a href="CraftingRecipes.html">here</a>.

                <div class="text-content">
                    <h3>Crafting</h3>
                    <p>
                        Crafting can be done in your inventory which you can access by pressing the e key. The crafting grid in your inventory is 2x2 and can
                        only make recipes that fit within this 2x2 area. However, the crafting table has a 3x3 crafting grid which allows for every crafting
                        recipe in the game to be made. Crafting is the basis of Minecraft, crafting is how you get better items and resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make a crafting table, you first have to make planks, to make planks you need to obtain a log which you get from punching trees.
                        Put the log into the crafting grid in your inventory and you'll see that in the output slot of the crafting grid, you can turn it
                        into four planks. You then put one plank each into each slot of the 2x2 crafting grid and you should have a crafting table in the 
                        output slot.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <img src="./Images/Basics/WoodPlanks.png" alt="Wood Planks">
            </div>
            <div class="imager-textl">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that you have a crafting table you'll want to craft some tools! Look for the pickaxe crafting recipe 
                        <a href="CraftingRecipes.html">here</a>. The pickaxe requires 2x sticks and 3x Planks to craft with the three planks on top
                        and the sticks in the center and bottom center. You might also want to make an axe, check the crafting recipe page for the recipe!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now you want to go mine some stone, if you can't find any at the surface, dig into the dirt, sand or whatever the ground is made of 
                        in the biome you're in until you reach the stone layer. Mine three stone and you're good, you can now craft a stone pickaxe. It's the 
                        same crafting recipe as the wooden pickaxe but the wood is replaced with stone. Stone pickaxes have a higher durability compared to 
                        wooden pickaxes as well as being able to mine blocks faster and being able to mine more ores. 
                    </p>

            <h2>Nighttime</h2>
            <div class="imager-textl">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <h3>Hostile Mods & Nighttime</h3>
                    <p>
                        Minecraft has day and night cycles and hostile mobs spawn at night and where light levels are low enough like in caves. You can see 
                        a more in depth look into mobs <a href="Mobs.html">here</a> but here's a brief rundown of the most common mobs you'll encounter at night.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Zombie</h4>
                    <p>
                        This mob will slowly chase you and if it touches you it will damage you and if it kills a villager there is a chance for the villager 
                        to turn into a zombie villager. This mob usually drops rotten flesh but rarely can drop an iron ingot, potato or carrot. 
                        They burn in the daylight.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The skeleton</h4>
                    <p>
                        This mob will try to shoot you with its bow from a distance, they have incredible aim which makes them very dangerous but they can be
                        counteracted with the help of a shield. They drop bones, arrows, and rarely a bow, they burn in the daylight.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Creeper</h4>
                    <p>
                        This mob will slowly chase you and try to explode if it gets near you, this explosion does immense damage even if wearing armor so try
                        not to stand too close when one of these explodes. They drop gunpowder and they do not burn in the daylight
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Spider</h4>
                    <p>
                        This mob can climb walls and often leaps at players, they are not very dangerous but don't underestimate them. They won't attack you 
                        during the day if you don't attack them but they will attack you like a normal hostile mob at night. They drop string and spider eyes,
                        they do not burn in the daylight.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Enderman</h4>
                    <p>
                        This mob can teleport, pick up blocks, and will attack you if you look into its eyes, it is very fast and hits very hard, try to avoid 
                        fighting these. Some countermeasures against them include low ceilings since they're almost 3 blocks tall they can't fit into two block
                        spaces. Also water, enderman hate water and will take damage from it if they touch it so if your in water they can't touch you. They 
                        drop ender pearls which when thrown teleport you to where the pearl lands, they don't burn in the daylight.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Witch</h4>
                    <p>
                        This mob attacks the player using potions and can also heal themselves using potions, they have a lot of health and are extremely 
                        dangerous since they can throw poison at you, if see one don't try to fight it unless properly geared up. A countermeasure to their 
                        poison is milk which you can get from using a bucket on a cow though milk buckets take up a lot of inventory space. Witches drop 
                        redstone, glowstone dust, sugar, gunpowder, sticks, glass bottles, and spider eyes, they don't burn in the daylight.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Phantom</h4>
                    <p>
                        This mob appears when you haven't slept for three in game days in Minecraft, they attack from the sky with swooping attacks and are very
                        hard to kill because of this. They drop phantom membranes which can be used to repair the late game item, the eleytra, in an anvil. They 
                        burn in the daylight.
                    </p>

                        To survive in Minecraft you're going to have fight mobs, here's a brief introduction into the combat system
                    </p>
                    <h4>Swords</h4>
                    <p>
                        The main weapon you will be using to kill mobs is the sword, axes do more damage but they have much slower attack speed than swords.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Cooldown</h4>
                    <p>
                        When you swing a weapon you'll notice a cooldown bar that shows up after your swing as well as your weapon lowered,
                        how fast this cooldown bar replenishes is based on the weapons attack speed, the higher the attack speed, the higher 
                        this bar replenishes. If you attack when this bar isn't full, you'll do much less damage.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Critical Hits</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you hit someone or something while you're falling in the air, you'll perform a critical hit and deal extra damage. This is most 
                        commonly performed by jumping up and hitting the player or mob on your way down.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Shields</h4>
                    <p>
                        Shields are essential to survival in Minecraft, they can block physical and ranged attacks and are relatively cheap to craft. 
                        Shields are how you mainly deal with hostile mobs such as the skeleton and they can even block a creeper blast. To use a shield 
                        equip it in your offhand slot and hold right click to block. [Note: These can break and you can't block forever with them]
                    </p>
                    <h4>Armor</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you wear armor you'll take less damage from attacks, the better armor you have, the less damage you'll take.

                    <h3>Food and Hunger</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unless you're playing in peaceful mode, you need to eat, but how does hunger work in Minecraft?
                    </p>
                    <h4>Hunger Bar</h4>
                    <p>
                        On the right side above your hotbat is your hunger bar, represented by 10 meat on bone symbols divided in half for a total of 20, 
                        various things happen at different levels and here they all are. At 18-20 hunger you can regenerate health. When your hunger bar is at 
                        6 or less you can't sprint anymore, you can only walk. When your hunger bar is at 0 you start to slowly take damage, the amount this stops at
                        depends on the difficulty you're playing, 5 hearts in easy difficulty, half a heart in normal difficulty, and it doesn't stop in hard
                        difficulty and kills you if you don't eat in time. Eating food you find or make can replenish your hunger bar.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Foods</h4>
                    <p>Different foods give you a different number of hunger back, for example bread gives you back 5 hunger while steak gives you back 8 hunger</p>
                    <h4>Saturation</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is a hidden stat of food, every food has a saturation and the higher the saturation, the longer you stay full which means you have to eat less
                    </p>
                    <h4>Cooking Food</h4>
                    <p>Food is cooked in a furnace, cooking food will usually raise the amount of hunger it restores and the saturation. You need fuel to keep 
                        the furnace cooking, you can use coal, charcoal, anything wood, or kelp to name a few.

                    <h3>Getting Iron</h3>
                    <p>
                        Alright, now that you know the basics of Minecraft, lets go mining for some iron so we can craft some armor! And remember, you need 
                        stone tools to mine iron ore.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Caves vs Strip Mining</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are two main ways to mine, finding a cave and mining there, or mining a staircase into the earth and tunneling. These both 
                        will usually lead to ores but in modern Minecraft caving is usually the better option, though you do have to watch out for hostile 
                        mobs that spawn in the caves. Also in the case of getting iron, caving is better. Though with both ways it is recommended that you 
                        use torches to keep the caves nice and bright so hostile mobs can't spawn.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Finding Caves</h4>
                    <p>
                        You can usually just find a cave by exploring the land and chancing upon its entrance. You can find caves while exploring the ocean 
                        as well since caves can generate underwater. You can also chance upon a cave while strip mining if you decided to go with that method.
                    </p>
                    <h4>F3</h4>
                    <p>
                        On your keyboard there is a key called F3, hitting f3 in Minecraft will show many stats about the game, where you are, what direction 
                        you're looking in, but you want to look at one specific spot, your coordinates. Your coordinates are split into three numbers, your x, 
                        y, and z which are east/west, up/down, and north/south respectively. The one you care about while strip mining is the y coordinate since certain 
                        ores spawn more frequently at certain y values compared to others. These coordinates are also helpful in helping you keep track of where 
                        you are.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Smelting Ores</h4>
                    <p>
                        When you find iron, gold, or copper, you have to smelt them into ingots using a furnace, as mentioned before you need a fuel to help 
                        the furnace smelt, when mining coal is a prime candidate for fuel since you can find a lot of it in caves though don't use it all since 
                        coal is what you use to make torches!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Crafting Armor and Tools</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once you have your iron, here's what you should make with it, an iron helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots, a shield, sword, and pickaxe. 
                        You can use your iron for other stuff but it's recommended to craft all of these items first. The total cost of all of those items is 
                        30x iron, 6x wood planks of any type, and 3x sticks. Here's a link to the <a href="CraftingRecipes.html">Crafting Recipes</a>
